## Overview

### The challenge

My initial goal for this project was to create a complete standard site with multiple pages without any dummy hyperlinks; then I realized I could make it better by designing it for the kind of business that I hope to exist someday.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Here](https://backticktech.netlify.app/)
- Source code URL: [Here]((https://github.com/SageKyle/backtick-technologies)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

This project really taught me the importance of planning and how an effective, well laid out design sytem can make all the difference.
This is the first multi-page website I've built thus far. Initially I used the same mindset I used to design landing pages and other simple projects. I just design and picture everything within my head and then I start from whichever is the beginning of the project (usually the header). 

Even though this method worked in the past, it proved really ineffective this time. It didn't take long before confusion set in about what color to use for a particular section or if I should use utility class to style a particular component.


### Continued Learning

As a result of my experience during the design process, I've decided to dedicate some time to learn design systems and also how to use Figma to create mockups.
